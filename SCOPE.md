# Requirements

1. It should ping a weather API online every 1 minute and get results of weather for current zip code.
2. It should contain a config file that allows the user to set their zip code, as well as the conditions that the bot should report under.
3. It should report to Slack chat when conditions are unfavorable.

# Best Practices

1. Find starter/boilerplate to begin building project.
2. Write tests for our code so that we can monitor that everything works properly.
3. We are going to use good, consistent usage of software development patterns.
4. We are going to use a debugger integrated with our bot so that we can see errors quicker.
5. We are going to use a linter to spot code and syntax errors in advance before our code gets published.
6. We are going to build a logger class to better monitor our application.
7. We are going to keep notes of everything we do.
8. We are going to use vscode's integrated terminal.
